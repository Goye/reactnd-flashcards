Readable Flashcards Project
-----------------------
Readable Flashcards project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

## To Run Locally

* install all project dependencies with `yarn`
* run the project with `yarn start`

You need Expo, Xcode, Node, Yarn installed on your machine.

## Keep in mind

This first version is working just for iOs (Android version coming soon!)

## Create React Native App

Install the [Expo](https://expo.io) app on your iOS or Android phone, and use the QR code in the terminal to open your app. Find the QR scanner on the Projects tab of the app. When you're ready to share your project with others (for example, by deploying to an app store), read the [Sharing & Deployment](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md#sharing-and-deployment) section of the User Guide.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
